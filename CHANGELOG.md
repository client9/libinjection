## security

* Fix Issue30: detection of more small sqli forms with fingerprint "1c".
* Fix Issue32: false positive of '*/*' of type 'oc'  Thanks to @brianrectanus

## API Changes

Should be fully backwards compatible.

* If arg4 in is_sqli is NULL, then  built-in fingerprint data will be
  used.  This makes it easier to use in most cases.
* sqlmap_data.json now includes fingerprint information, so people making ports
  only need to parse one file.
* sqli_fingerprints.h is now deprecated, this functionality is now included
  in sqlparse_data.h.  Now most users will now only need to include sqlparse.h,
  instead of two files.

## other

* Allow clang compiler (also in Jenkins, a build with clang and
  make-scan is done)
